<h1> A Special Masws for the Animals to celebrate World Animal Day</h1>
	
People would have their cars and house blessed, so why not their companion animals? This was exactly what PAWS President Ms. Nita Hontiveros-Lichauco had in mind 2 decades ago when she started the pet blessing to commemorate the Feast of Saint Francis of Assisi.

This year, on October 1,  thousands of pet owners brought their pet to SM North Edsa Skydome not just to celebrate the feast of Saint Francis but also to celebrate World Animal Day. The event started with a procession around the SM Sky Garden headed by the Members of the MMDA K9 Corps and PAWS volunteers with adoptable dogs Chessie, Renz, Choco and Dorothy.
	
<h1>At Bon ApPEtit, pets and humans dine for a cause</h1>
    
	It was the best party ever, for me, at least. I got to take Puppy, my eight-week-old Bichon pup, with me to the event, which was filled with dog lovers and foodies — who are also staunch supporters of The Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS).
I have been attending PAWS events for almost 15 years now and when I started covering these pet events, I remember I would be the only media guest around. At the latest PAWS event last Sunday, July 23, there were over 300 guests and 150 dogs — and lots of other media folks, too.

That the event was held at Viking Venue at SM by the Bay was another welcome development for the pet lover in me.
“This is the first time pets were allowed to dine together with their owners inside a buffet restaurant,” said Rich Ilustre, PAWS director.  “Pet Express and PAWS collaborated to provide pet lovers and their dogs with the ultimate food adventure experience, and it was a roaring success.”
    
<h1>A Howling and meowing Halloween</h1>
    
MANILA, Philippines - Scaredy Cats & Dogs,”  the Halloween pet costume competition organized by the Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), was held at the Fisher Mall Event Center last Oct. 24.

For this year, most of the entries were characters from popular movies or costumes crafted straight from the vivid imagination of the pet owners.

​The 2015 Transylvanian Star (best pet in costume) was awarded to Jacks, a Pomeranian who came as Ghost Rider, while the Phantom’s Pick (most creative pet costume) was awarded to Klondike as Zorro, who was also the most photographed dog at the event 
   
<h1>600 Pe3ts were blessed at the PAWS Pet Blessing 2015</h1>
   
   	600 pets were blessed by Father Joey Paras and Father Bob Zarate at this year's PAWS Pet Blessing held  in partnership with PET EXPRESS, at the Skydome of SM North Edsa last Sunday, October 4th 2015. 

Pets were blessed right after a special  Mass for the Animals in celebration of the Feast of Saint Francis of Assisi, patron saint of animals and the ecology. October 4 also marked the celebration of World Animal Day. 

The  unique Mass had cats and dogs, and their owners participate in the Offertory and in the Liturgical  Readings.
