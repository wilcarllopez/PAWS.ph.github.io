                <p>Only those procedures approved by the Committee shall be used in the killing of animals.</p>

                <p><strong>SECTION 7.  It shall be unlawful for any person who has custody to an animal to abandon the animal.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>If any person being the owner or having charge or control of any animal shall without reasonable cause or excuse abandon it, whether permanently or not, without providing for the care of that animal, such act shall constitute maltreatment under Section 9.</strong></p>


                <p><strong>If the animal is left in circumstances likely to cause the animal any unnecessary suffering, or if this abandonment results in the death of the animal, the person liable shall suffer the maximum penalty.</strong></p>


                <p><strong>Abandonment means the relinquishment of all right, title, claim, or possession of the animal with the intention of not reclaiming its ownership or possession.</strong></p>


                <p><strong>SECTION 8.  It shall be the duty of every person to protect the natural habitat of the wildlife.  The destruction of said habitat shall be considered as a form of cruelty to animals and its preservation is a way of protecting the animals.</strong></p>


                <p><strong>SECTION 9.  Any person who subjects any animal to cruelty, maltreatment or neglect shall, upon conviction by final judgment, be punished by imprisonment and/or fine, as indicated in the following graduated scale:</strong></p>


                <p><strong>1)   Imprisonment of one (1) year and six (6) months and one (1) day to two (2) years and/or fine not exceeding One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) if the animal subjected to cruelty, maltreatment, or neglect dies;</strong></p>


                <p><strong>2)  Imprisonment of one (1) year and one (1) day to one (1) year and six (6) months and/or a fine not exceeding Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) if the animal subjected to cruelty, maltreatment or neglect survives but is severely injured with loss of its natural faculty to survive on its own and needing human intervention to sustain its life; and</strong></p>


                <p><strong>3)   Imprisonment of six (6) months to one (1) year and/or fine not exceeding Thirty thousand pesos (P30,000.00) for subjecting any animal to cruelty, maltreatment or neglect but without causing its death or incapacitating it to survive on its own.</strong></p>


                <p><strong>If the violation is committed by a juridical person, the officer responsible thereof shall serve the imprisonment.  If the violation is committed by an alien, he or she shall be immediately deported after the service of sentence without any further proceeding.</strong></p>


                <p><strong>The foregoing penalties shall also apply for any other violation of this Act, depending upon the effect or result of the act or omission as defined immediately in the preceding sections.</strong></p>


                <p><strong>However, regardless of the resulting condition to the animals, the penalty of two (2) years and one (1) day to three (3) years ad/or a fine not exceeding Two hundred fifty thousand pesos (P250,000.00) shall be imposed if the offense is committed by any of the following: (1) a syndicate; (2) an offender who makes business out of cruelty to an animal; (3) a public officer or employee; or (4) where at least three (3) animals are involved.</strong></p>


                <p><strong>In any of the foregoing situations, the offender shall suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and the inability to pay the fine.</strong></p>


                <p><strong>SECTION 10. The Secretary of the Department of Agriculture shall deputize animal welfare enforcement officers from nongovernment organizations, citizens groups, community organizations and other volunteers who have undergone the necessary training for this purpose.  The Philippine National Police, the National Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies shall designate animal welfare enforcement officers.  As such, animal welfare enforcement officers shall have the authority to seize and rescue illegally traded and maltreated animals and to arrest violators of this Act subject to the guidelines of existing laws and rules and regulations on arrest and detention.</strong></p>
 

                <p><strong>The Secretary of the Department of Agriculture shall upon the recommendation of the Committee on Animal Welfare:</strong></p>


                <p><strong>1)   Promulgate the guidelines on the criteria and training requirements for the deputization of animal welfare enforcement officers; and</strong></p>


                <p><strong>2)   Establish a mechanism for the supervision monitoring and reporting of these enforcement officers.</strong></p>


                <p><strong>(SECTION 11.)  If for any reason, any provision of this Act is declared to be unconstitutional or invalid, the other sections or provisions hereof which are not affected shall continue to be in full force and effect.</strong></p>


                <p><strong>All laws, decrees, orders, rules and regulations and other issuances or parts thereof which are inconsistent with the provisions of this Act are hereby deemed repealed, amended or modified accordingly.</strong></p>


                <p><strong>This Act shall take effect after fifteen (15) days from its publication in the Official Gazette, or in at least two (2) newspapers of general circulation, whichever comes earlier.</strong></p>
