                <h3>Frequently Asked Questions about Spaying and Neutering</h3> 
                    
                <strong>WHAT IS STERILIZATION/SPAYING/NEUTERING?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sterilization in dogs/cats is a routine surgical procedure wherein the testicles of males (neutering) and ovaries+uterus of females (spaying) are removed. A veterinarian does the procedure while the animal is under sedation and general anesthesia. Sterilization is a method of population control for our own pets and for stray dogs/cats, which are at least 6 months old.</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>WHAT ARE SOME BENEFITS OF STERILIZATION?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prevention of unwanted/unplanned pregnancies in female pet dogs/cats, which results in excessive litters.</li>
                    <li>Humane population control for stray dogs/cats, which would facilitate the control of diseases that may be transmitted to humans (such as rabies, leptospirosis, scabies, fungal infections).</li>
                    <li>Ease of providing the proper care for one or a few pets, compared to a large number of pets in a household.</li>
                    <li>Prevention of pyometra (infection in the uterus) in female dogs/cats.</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>ARE THERE HEALTH RISKS TO STERILIZATION?</strong>

                <p>Sterilization itself is a fast and simple procedure that is commonly done. However, just as with any surgical procedure in humans that involves sedatives and general anesthetics, the same health concerns exist for dogs/cats. Nevertheless, adverse reactions to the drugs are actually rare.</p>    

                <strong>HOW WILL I KNOW IF MY PET IS FIT FOR SURGERY?</strong> 

                <p>General health status and fitness for surgery is assessed based on blood tests and a physical examination. The blood tests (complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests) are highly recommended (often mandatory) for dogs/cats that are four years old and older; the tests are optional for younger animals.</p>

                <strong>WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ON THE DAY BEFORE STERILIZATION?</strong>

                <p>Fast your dog/cat from food and water from 10 oâ€™clock on the evening before the day of surgery. This is an important step in preparing your pet for the coming surgery.</p>  

                <strong>REMINDER</strong>

                <p>Upon booking your appointment, kindly inform the veterinarian if your male dog/cat has only one descended testicle. There are special considerations for animals with retained testicles.</p>

                <h6>Spay/Neuter Post-Operative Care</h6>
                 
                <strong>HOW MANY HOURS WILL IT TAKE BEFORE A STERILIZED DOG/CAT FULLY RECOVERS FROM ANESTHESIA?</strong>

                <p>The time of recovery from the anesthesia varies per individual animal. Generally, the dog/cat should be fully awake approximately 6-10 hours after the surgery. Nevertheless, from one hour post-surgery, there should be visible signs of gradual recovery.</p> 

                <strong>WHAT MUST BE DONE WHILE WAITING FOR A STERILIZED DOG/CAT TO RECOVER FROM THE ANESTHESIA?</strong> 

                <p>Remember that recovery will be gradual. The animal will be uncoordinated and groggy for several hours. With this in mind, keep the dog/cat secure in a cage or a place where he/she is free from any danger. Do not tie/tether your pet to prevent accidental strangulation. Temporarily remove the food/water bowls and any other potential obstacles/structures (especially glass items) in the recovery cage/area that may injure the recovering dog/cat. Make sure the recovery cage/area is well ventilated, free from excessive heat, and safe from the rain. It should also be free from drafts, because an animalâ€™s body temperature drops while under anesthetics. Monitor the recovering dog/cat at least hourly to make sure that he/she is relatively comfortable and recovering from the anesthesia.<p> 

                <strong>HAT ARE SOME OF THE SIGNS THAT THE DOG/CAT IS RECOVERING FROM THE ANESTHESIA?</strong>

                <p>The initial signs of recovery would include twitching of the ears and blinking of the eyelids. After some hours, the dog/cat should be able to move his/her head and paws/legs. Eventually, the dog/cat will attempt to sit-up/stand and/or walk. Do remember that an animal is not fully recovered if he/she is still uncoordinated/groggy, or moves/barks/meows like a drunken human.</p>

                <strong>WHEN CAN A NEWLY STERILIZED DOG/CAT BE FED?</strong> 

                <p>Feeding is only done once the dog/cat is fully awake, and fully capable of eating independently, and swallowing food and water properly. This would be approximately 6-10 hours after the surgery. First offer small amounts of water. Then offer a light meal (approximately one-third to one-half of his/her usual portion). Giving too much food or water too soon runs the risk of choking, vomiting, or indigestion. You may resume with the regular feeding portions the following day.</p> 

                <strong>WHEN CAN A STERILIZED DOG/CAT BE BATHED?</strong> 

                <p>Bathing can be done once the surgical wound is completely healed, and once the dog/cat has fully recovered from the operation. This would be about 7-10 days after surgery and/or after the sutures have been removed. Check with the veterinarian if you have to come back for suture removal.</p> 

                <strong>HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR THE SURGICAL WOUND TO HEAL?</strong> 

                <p>Healing time varies with every individual animal. It is influenced by age, sex and general health. It usually takes between 5-10 days to heal completely. Proper post-operative care and management is important during this period after surgery.</p> 

                <strong>WHAT ARE SOME OF THE IMPORTANT REMINDERS FOR THE FIRST 5-10 DAYS AFTER SURGERY?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Follow the veterinarianâ€™s prescription and instructions, if any. Usually, there will be a prescription for antibiotics and notes on wound cleaning. Inquire with the veterinarian after the surgery.</li>
                    <li>Inspect the wound once to twice daily to make sure that it is healing properly and that there are no signs of infection.</li>
                    <li>Allow the dog/cat to rest and recuperate, especially on the first three days after surgery.</li>
                    <li>No running and jumping and excessive playing, especially during the first five days after surgery. This is to prevent jarring and bleeding of the operated internal tissues/structures.</li>
                    <li>No licking, nibbling, or biting of the surgical wound or sutures. This is to prevent infection of the wound and dehiscence of the sutures. If necessary, let your dog/cat wear an e-collar or buster collar to prevent him/her from reaching the surgical wound.</li>
                    <li>Keep the surgical wound and surrounding areas clean and dry. This is to prevent infection. If the area accidentally gets wet, gently wipe/dab it with cotton or a clean cloth to dry it. If the area gets dirty, gently clean it using hydrogen peroxide.</li> 
                    <li>Do not allow flies to hover about or lay their eggs on or around the surgical wound.</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>CONSULT THE VETERINARIAN IMMEDIATELY IF YOU NOTICE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING DURING THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER STERILIZATION:</strong>
                <ul>
                   <li>pus, excessive swelling and pain, continuous bleeding, or dehiscence of stitches from or in the surgical wound</li>
                    <li>depression or lethargy</li>
                    <li>loss of appetite and/or water intake</li>
                    <li>vomiting</li>
                </ul>
