<h1>School Tours</h1>

A 15-minute tour and 20-minute lecture at the Multi-Purpose Hall can be given by sending us a letter of request at least two weeks ahead of the date of the visit.  The "fee" for tour and lecture is a donation of one (1) tall can of cat food - any brand brought by each person attending.

The organizers will also be furnished with an updated PAWS' shelter WISH LIST so that they can launch collection drives for used or second-hand items that may be useful to shelter animals. 

No tour or lecture will be considered confirmed unless the organizer has received emailed confirmation from philpaws@paws.org.ph regardless of what may be advised by any volunteer answering our office phone. 

All confirmations are sent via email and properly scheduled. No tours will be entertained before the 10 am opening and after the 5pm closing time. 

Please note that the shelter is open to the public, and anyone can take a 'non-guided' tour. Guided tours and lectures for groups,however, need prior arrangement with the PAWS admin officer, shelter director or the program director. 

Maximum number of people for group tour: Twenty-five (25) at any given time. 


<h1>Students Interviews</h1>

We require students to give a written commitment that they will use information for the purposes of their study only and "give PAWS a hard copy of the thesis, research paper, video, reaction paper etcetera, within three days from their submission to their professor". 

This letter should be signed by the student, noted by the professor and should indicate the phone number of the school, the student and the professor. 

<h1>Letters should be addressed to:</h1>

Ms. Nita Hontiveros-Lichauco 
President
The Philippine Animal Welfare Society
and sent to  philpaws@paws.org.ph  and cc: sharon.yap@paws.org.ph or the printed letters may be dropped off at the PARC (Aurora Blvd., Katipunan Valley, Loyola Heights, QC) at least one and a half weeks prior to the date of visit. 

Interviews will be scheduled only when this signed letter has been emailed. 

No student interview will be granted without the aforementioned signed letter. Students are requested to check the PAWS' website for the general information on PAWS before they prepare their questionnaires. Most of the time, the information being asked is already available on the website. Students are also requested to avoid requesting for interview dates that coincide with major events of the organization. These events are announced on the website and on the PAWS Facebook. 

<h1>School Visits</h1>

If you want a PAWS Humane Education speaker to visit your school, a signed letter of request should be addressed to

Ms. Nita Hontiveros-Lichauco 
President
The Philippine Animal Welfare Society

and sent to   philpaws@paws.org.ph  and cc: sharon.yap@paws.org.ph or the printed letters may be dropped off at the PARC (Aurora Blvd., Katipunan Valley, Loyola Heights, QC) at least one and a half weeks prior to the date of visit. 


Your letter should indicate number of students, age of students, availability/non-availability of audio-visual equipment and microphone/sound system, venue of talk (outdoor/indoor, conference room, auditorium).

While our humane education program is given completely free of charge, we request that transport be provided for our speaker/s so that PAWS does not incur any expense. 

Organizers will also be furnished with an updated PAWS' shelter WISH LIST so that they can launch collection drives for used or second-hand items a few days before PAWS' visit. The PAWS speaker may bring back the donations to the shelter after the talk.
